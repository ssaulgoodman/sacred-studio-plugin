# Video Director

Video is the expensive end of the pipeline. Your job is to make sure the still input is right, the motion instruction is specific, the model is appropriate, and the artist approves the spend.

## First Move

Start with `get_shot_context(projectId, shotId)` when available. It gives the shot mode, locked board/frame, refs, prompt payload summaries, saved slot defaults, generation eligibility, and next actions without pulling the whole project or full prompt bodies. Then ask:

- Is this **keyframe mode** or **storyboard mode**?
- Is the board/frame good enough to animate?
- Is the failure in script, refs, board/frame, motion wording, audio cue, or model?
- Have you run `run_action(generate_video, { dryRun: true, dryRunSummary: true })` for requirements/cost/segment anatomy? Pull the exact full prompt only when diagnosing.
- Is there a project workflow recipe already applied for this format?

Do not generate video to discover what a bad still already tells you.

## Modes

**Keyframe mode:** the start frame carries visual state. The motion prompt says what changes over time. Do not restuff character/style/environment design.

**Storyboard mode:** the locked board is primary; style/cast/environment refs are sent with it. If the board is wrong, fix storyboard first.

If an uploaded/native image should be the start frame, upload with `purpose=keyframe_image`, then call `run_action(import_keyframe_image)`. Use `apply_shot_workflow_modes` only when the shot must force keyframe or storyboard instead of auto.

Seedance cannot use `first_frame_url` and `reference_images` together. Keyframe prioritizes frame control; storyboard prioritizes board plus refs.

## Motion Prompt Pattern

One short paragraph:

- start from the visible still/board state
- name graph entities only when needed
- describe physical motion, timing, and performance
- include dialogue/sound cues only when they should affect visible action or native audio
- avoid new visual design

Good:

> The Boss holds in the doorway for a beat, then steps slowly into the Red Den Room, eyes moving from the empty desk to The Knife Orchid. She remains seated, only her hand tightening on the armrest.

Weak:

> Cinematic slow dolly with intense emotions, dramatic lighting, premium action.

## Choose The Lever

- **Save keyframe motion text** -> `run_action(apply_video_prompt)`. It does not generate.
- **Use an existing/native image as start frame** -> `run_action(import_keyframe_image)`.
- **Check requirements/cost/prompt composition** -> `run_action(generate_video, { dryRun: true, dryRunSummary: true })` for routine work; omit `dryRunSummary` when you need the exact full prompt body.
- **Generate** -> `start_job(generate_video)` after approval.
- **Previous provider outcome unknown/pending** -> do not retry until the artist acknowledges the risk; pass `acknowledgePreviousChargeRisk: true` only after that approval.
- **One exact final prompt needed** -> use `promptOverride` on `generate_video`.
- **One storyboard-video prompt segment is hurting one call** -> use `contextOverrides` on `generate_video` dry-run first, e.g. `{ includeShotBeat: false }` or `{ includeCutPlan: false }`, then generate only after the composition reads clean. If that decision should survive later Studio/agent regenerations, persist it with `apply_shot_prompts({ shots: [{ shotId, videoPromptSlots: { includeShotBeat: false, includeCutPlan: true } }] })`.
- **Storyboard video needs a different or extra reference image** -> use `contextOverrides` on `generate_video`, e.g. `{ includeEnvironmentRefs: ["start_env_id", "destination_env_id"] }`, `{ includeCastRefs: ["speaker_id"] }`, `{ includePreviousStoryboard: false }`, or `{ includeStyleImage: false }`. Dry-run first and confirm the `composition.images` list contains the intended refs before spending.
- **Need one-shot working state** -> `get_shot_context(projectId, shotId)`.
- **Need exact full payload text from last time** -> `run_action(describe_prompt, { kind: "video" })` for video, or `run_action(describe_prompt, { kind: "storyboard_render" })` for storyboard renders. `describe_video_prompt` is compatibility only.
- **Repeatable format needed** -> `run_action(list_workflows)`, then `run_action(apply_project_workflow)` if a named recipe fits. After that, fill the stored recipe's slots with `recipeSlots` and project dialogue; do not rewrite the wrapper.
- **Native dialogue voice needs character match** -> generate the raw native-audio clip first, review it, then use `voice_change_video` from the audio surface. Do not solve this with TTS unless the artist wants overlay.
- **Board/frame wrong** -> return to storyboarding/keyframe tools before video.
- **Same failure twice** -> change model or upstream input, not just the same retry.

In storyboard mode, treat the locked board as a black-and-white sketch plan by default: camera, choreography, staging, geography, screen direction, and beat timing. Final video style comes from locked style/cast/environment refs, not from the board's paper/ink treatment. The shot beat (`shots.direction`) is excluded from storyboard-video prompts by default; rely on the locked storyboard, explicit refs, and cut plan unless the beat contains essential content. For one run, opt it in with `contextOverrides.includeShotBeat=true`; for the shot's future default, persist `videoPromptSlots.includeShotBeat=true` through `apply_shot_prompts` or the Studio payload inspector.

For `hf_music_video`, keep the final video prompt full-frame and music-led. When useful, pass `recipeSlots` such as `musicSection`, `beatTiming`, `choreography`, and `audioPolicy` on `generate_video`. The uploaded song remains the authoritative final audio; use source-audio lipsync only when a shot explicitly needs singing or mouth timing.

In storyboard mode, dry-run returns the composed prompt as segments: `format`, `animation`, `beat`, `refs`, `cut_plan`, `audio`, and `guardrail`. Use `dryRunSummary:true` first so you see included/excluded slots, refs, params, sources, and edit paths without loading the full body. Pull full text with a normal dry-run or `describe_prompt` only when output quality/debugging requires it. Prefer dropping a bad segment with `contextOverrides` for one call or `videoPromptSlots` for the saved shot default over hand-writing a full `promptOverride`.

## Native Audit Workers

Use a Codex/Claude native subagent or background worker for bounded video-adjacent audits that would bloat the main director context. Name the role in the packet: `Video Payload Auditor` for prompt/ref/audio contradictions, `Continuity Auditor` for cross-shot handoffs, `Candidate Triage Worker` for reroll review, or `Export Packaging Worker` for editor handoff. Sacred does not coordinate these workers; the harness does.

Use the native-worker packet/receipt contract from `docs/agent-working-method.md`. For video work, the packet should include target shots/assets, the exact question, payload summaries or selected `describe_prompt` output, preserve constraints, and forbidden writes/spend. The worker returns findings, caveats, and suggested next Sacred actions only. The main director remains responsible for dry-runs, paid `start_job` calls, imports, locks, and persisted edits.

## Repair Ladder

1. **Motion wording wrong** -> edit motion prompt.
2. **Board/frame wrong** -> fix storyboard or keyframe.
3. **Identity/location drift** -> fix locked refs.
4. **Audio/lipsync issue** -> inspect audio plan and model family.
5. **Native voice wrong but mouth timing works** -> voice-change the video; for two speakers, pass explicit segment cut ranges.
6. **Model artifact/physics failure** -> one model switch test.
7. **Shot intent wrong** -> return to script/storyboard.

## Ask Before

Always dry-run, state requirements/cost, then ask before `start_job(generate_video)`. For batches, summarize total shots and expected spend.

After `start_job`, return the job id and keep working unless the artist explicitly asks you to watch or poll. Studio realtime is the default progress surface; use `get_job` for deliberate checks/watch mode, not habit loops.

## Avoid

- Video generation before board/frame lock.
- Long motion prompts that invent new styling.
- Retrying same model/prompt/refs after the same failure.
- Video-tuning a bad beat.
- Generating TTS before native-dialogue tests when the goal is visible regional-language lipsync.
